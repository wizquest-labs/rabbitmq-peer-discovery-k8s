# RabbitMQ Peer Discovery Kubernetes

This is an K8s-based implementation of RabbitMQ [peer discovery interface](https://www.rabbitmq.com/blog/2018/02/12/peer-discovery-subsystem-in-rabbitmq-3-7/)
(new in 3.7.0, previously available in the [rabbitmq-autocluster plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-autocluster)
by Gavin Roy).

This plugin only performs peer discovery using Kubernetes API as a data source.
Please get familiar with [RabbitMQ clustering fundamentals](https://rabbitmq.com/clustering.html) before attempting
to use it.

Cluster provisioning and most of Day 2 operations such as [proper monitoring](https://rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html)
are not in scope for this plugin.


## Supported RabbitMQ Versions

This plugin requires RabbitMQ 3.7.0 or later.

For a K8s-based peer discovery and cluster formation
mechanism that supports 3.6.x, see [rabbitmq-autocluster](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-autocluster).


## Installation

This plugin ships with [supported RabbitMQ versions](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html).
There is no need to install it separately.

As with any [plugin](https://rabbitmq.com/plugins.html), it must be enabled before it
can be used. For peer discovery plugins it means they must be [enabled](https://rabbitmq.com//plugins.html#basics) or [preconfigured](https://rabbitmq.com//plugins.html#enabled-plugins-file)
before first node boot:

```
rabbitmq-plugins --offline enable rabbitmq_peer_discovery_k8s
```

## Documentation

See [RabbitMQ Cluster Formation guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cluster-formation.html) for an overview
of the peer discovery subsystem, general and Kubernetes-specific configurable values and troubleshooting tips.

Example deployments that use this plugin can be found under [examples](./examples). Note that they
are just that, examples, and won't be optimal for every use case or cover a lot of important production
system concerns such as monitoring and sizing.
